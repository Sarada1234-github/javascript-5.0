what is javascript and why we use it?
-java script is a logic based programming language where we can create our code project functionality in that.
-JS is a high level programming laguage for build web pages.
-now we used the ES6 (echma script 6)version of JS, in other word we called vanila javascript.
-runtime envioroment of javascript is node js.

variable:-

variable is a container to store some data.
in javascript we have 3 type of variables
1. let :-
- Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
- now these days most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
- let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases
-
2. var
- var is atype of variable which is also used for cchanging the variable later stage.
- var is used in oldest  browser so now a days we dont use var most of the time.

3. const 
- const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
- const means constant to store some data like number ,integer etc...

task:-  
       1. difference betwwen let and var 
       
      1. SCOPE:-
      - VAR:- function scoped,means that if we declare a variable with VAR inside a function ,then it can be accessible throughout the entire function.
       -LET:- block scoped means if we declare a variable with LET inside a block ,it is only accessible within that block.
       2.HOISTING:-
       VAR :- variables declared with VAR are hoisted to the top of their scope.that means they are available through out their scope,but they are initialized with UNDEFINED untill the actual line of code where they are assigned a value.
       -LET:- variables declared with LET are also hoisted but they are not initialized.that means they are not accessable before their declaration line , resulting in a REFERENCEeRROR if you try  to access before they are declared.
       3.REDECLARATION:-
       -VAR:- you can redeclare a VAR within the same scope without any iisues.
       -LET:- redeclaring a let variable in the same scope results  a SYNTAXERROR. 
       2. difference betwwen var and const.
       3. what do you mean by hoisting.(when we don't declare value of variable but it execute the code)
