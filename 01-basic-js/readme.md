variable:-

variable is a container to store some data.
in javascript we have 3 type of variables
1. let :-
- Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
- now these days most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
- let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases
-
2. var
- var is atype of variable which is also used for cchanging the variable later stage.
- var is used in oldest  browser so now a days we dont use var most of the time.

- const means constant to store some data like number ,integer etc...
