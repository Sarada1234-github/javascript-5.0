what is javascript and why we use it?
-java script is a logic based programming language where we can create our code project functionality in that.
-JS is a high level programming laguage for build web pages.
-now we used the ES6 (echma script 6)version of JS, in other word we called vanila javascript.
-runtime envioroment of javascript is node js.

variable:-

variable is a container to store some data.
in javascript we have 3 type of variables
1. let :-
- Let is a type of variable which is used for changing the variable name later.
- now these days most of the cases we used let for creating variable.
- let is a block scope code so we have been using let for most of the cases
-
2. var
- var is atype of variable which is also used for cchanging the variable later stage.
- var is used in oldest  browser so now a days we dont use var most of the time.

3. const 
- const is a type of variable where we can't change our data further.
- const means constant to store some data like number ,integer etc...

task:-  
       1. difference betwwen let and var
       2. difference betwwen var and const.
       3. what do you mean by haisting.(when we don't declare value of variable but it execute the code)


RULES OF VARIABLE:-
- variable names are case sensitive "A" &"a" is different
- only letter ,digit,underscore & $ are allowed.
- only letter ,underscore or $ should be 1st charecter.
- reserver words cannot be variable names.

DATATYPES IN JAVASCRIPT :-
 - datatype is an attribute associatedvwith a piece of data tells a computer system how to interpret its value.
 - in data type we used "typeof" operator to know what type of data it is.
 - mainly in javascrit their are 2 types of datatype.
 1. premitive :-
  - in javascript there are 7 types of premitive datatypes.
  1. number :-number are the type of datatype those it contain some numerical value.
  2. string :- string is a type of data type that can hpld some charecter like names...
  3. boolean : -.in boolean datatype we get boolean value like true and false.
  4. undefined :- in un defined data type data is not define so that it will show undefined.
  5. null : - in this data type we will gwt null for all the values ,means nothing.
  6. bigint :- in this datatype we will gwt big integer.
  7. symbol:-in symbol we will gwt symbol as well as the value we get for the datatype.

 2. non-premitive :-
 - non-premitivve datatype are that type of data type that can hold multiple items in a single time.
 - non - premitive data types are- object,array,function.
   
   object :-
   - object is a non premitive datatype ehich can hold multi[ple of item in one single entity
   -mainly objects are working on (key:value)pair
   - the left hand side our keys and right hand side are the values of the following object.

   ex-
   prathama = {
       college :"GIET",
 address : "BBSR",
 age : 45,
 salary : "4500"
 carrier : "good" 
   }

   OPERATORS IN JS :-
   - Operator are the key features to do some task or operate some task.
   - ex :- A + B
   - in the above example A & B are the operands ,'+' is the operators to do the addition.
   1. ARITHMATIC OPERATOR :-
   (+;-;*;/)
   Modulous-> %xponention -> **
   increment -> ++
   decrement -> --
   e
